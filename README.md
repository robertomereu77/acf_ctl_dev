# Avaloq Cloud Service Framework

*DRAFT: Don't Use - Still Under Development*

The Avaloq Cloud Service Framework (ACSF) is a collection of deployment scripts that connect cloud services running on Azure, AWS or Google with applications running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## Development Module
The development version of the [Foundation Module](https://github.com/avaloqcloud/acf_ctl_root) and enables engineers to develop a set of deployment parameter and the respective resource configurations without appplying these configuration in deployment scripts. It accelerates the development process, because engineers can create and validate the output of the [configuration module](https://github.com/avaloqcloud/acf_ctl_config) against the service provider definitions without invoking the cloud controller.
